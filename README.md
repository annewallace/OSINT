# OSINT
Collection of OSINT projects

keywordmon.py - Pastebin and meta search keyword monitoring script based off work done by Justin Seitz @ automatingosint.com.  The script is mostly his but some code was added to continue running despite errors (network interruptions, etc.).  http://www.automatingosint.com/blog/2017/04/building-a-keyword-monitoring-pipeline-with-python-pastebin-and-searx/

phunter.py - Pastebin Yara hunting script based off work done by Kevin Breen @ techanarchy.net.  Again mostly his work but some mods were necessary to get it functioning in my environment.  Still having some issues I need to work out.  Link to pastehunter: https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter
